# Loan Calculator

Loan calculator built using React. It uses Sliders to set the loan amount and the months of payment. When both the sliders are set, the interest rate and the monthly payment are automatically calculated without any user interaction.
The data is received from `https://ftl-frontend-test.herokuapp.com/interest?amount=<amount>&numMonths=<numMonths>` where `<amount>` and `<numMonths>` are required parameters.
Developed with fully responsive design in order to look good in all devices.
